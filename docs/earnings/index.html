    <h1>Liquidity Provider Returns (Work in Progress)</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>We intend to measure the difference in <strong>current value</strong> vs. the
            <strong>value added</strong>. Value can be measured in USD, RUNE, or the pool
            asset, hereafter just Asset.
        </br>
            For simple scenarios the definitions of "current value" and "value added" are
            straightforward, for example, consider the case of a liquidity provider adding
            liquidity once, and waiting some time:
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>current value</strong> corresponds to the value of withdrawing the provided
                liquidity and converting it to the valuation currency at the market
                price. This is called "mark to market" value or "redeemable value". The valuation currency
                can be USD, RUNE, or Asset.</li>
                <li>The <strong>value added</strong> corresponds to the value of the added liquidity
                    just before it was added. For this, the market price of the added RUNE and Asset
                    <em>at the time of the action</em> are used to compute the value in
                    the valuation currency.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>For more complicated cases, since we do not know the source of funds for added
                liquidity, nor what happened to the withdrawn liquidity, we need to make some
                assumptions. Here are some sensible options:
                <ol>
                    <li>USD: Assume all provided liquidity was funded by converting USD,
                        and all withdrawn liquidity was immediately converted to USD.</li>
                    <li>RUNE: Assume all provided liquidity was funded by converting RUNE,
                        and all withdrawn liquidity was immediately converted to RUNE.</li>
                    <li>Asset: Assume all provided liquidity was funded by converting Asset,
                        and all withdrawn liquidity was immediately converted to Asset.</li>
                </ol>
                Let's consider the first case: USD. With this assumption we can compute
                "current value" and "value added" as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Current value</strong> is the sum of the "mark to market" value of liquidity
                    still in the pool (as above) and the value of the withdrawn liquidity in the
                    valuation currency. Note that we use the market price of the RUNE and Asset
                    <em>at the time the liquidity was withdrawn</em> and not the current price.</li>
                    <li><strong>Value added</strong> is the value of all added liquidity in
                        the valuation currency. We use the market price of the RUNE and Asset
                        <em>at the time the liquidity was added</em> and not the current price.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Using the above methodology, we compute:
                <ul>
                    <li>The <strong>added value</strong></li>
                    <li>The <strong>withdrawn value</strong></li>
                    <li>The <strong>redeemable value</strong>: the mark to market value of the liquidity in the pool (it excludes withdrawn value)</li>
                    <li>The <strong>realized return value</strong>: value withdrawn less the added value</li>
                    <li>The <strong>total return value</strong>: the sum of the redeemable value and the realized return</li>
                </ul>
                These are computed for each of the three valuation currencies - USD, RUNE, Asset - using the
                assumption that the added and withdrawn liquidity are sourced and converted to the valuation
                currency at the time of the event, as described above.
